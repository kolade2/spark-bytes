# Project Description: 
This project seeks to eliminate food waste at Boston University. If there is left over food at an event held at BU, the webapp will allow for a text message to be sent to phones in the area. 


# Project Goal: 
By the end of BostonHacks we would like to be able to send text messages if leftover food is available on campus. 
Additionally, we want to consider security so, we will have users sign up with BU email and phone number (kerbros login). 

# Nice to have:
A nice to have feature includes adding a range proximity (google maps API) to be able to send texts out to those who are in the surrounding area.
